## Introduction

[DGLE2](http://dgle.dronprogs.org) is a powerful cross platform engine for 2D/3D games and real-time visualizations. Young, strong and crazy!

The aim of the project is to create flexible and extensible technology that any user can use to create various games, real-time visualizations or
scientific applications. It should be easy to make great projects only by using editors and scripts or go deeper and use your programming skills
of your favorite language to create really exciting projects. Users can also add new formats and functionality by creating new plugins for engine
and share them with others over the web or just get plugins already made by others. When project is complete it can be easily build for every popular platform.
